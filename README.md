This repository contains the XENONnT solar boron-8 neutrino and light dark matter searches data release, including post-selection data, binning definitions, likelihood templates, upper limit results, and example code. The provided monoenergetic nuclear recoil templates allow users to construct their own signal models by convolving them with custom nuclear recoil spectra.

## Data

The observed data are four-dimensional, with the following observables:

1. Corrected S2 signal amplitude (cS2)
2. Quantile of $`\mathrm{S2}_\mathrm{pre}/\Delta t_\mathrm{pre}`$
3. S1 BDT score
4. S2 BDT score

The post-selection data for each science run (SR) are stored as `.csv` files in the `data` folder.

## Binning

An extended binned likelihood fit is performed. The bin edges for all four dimensions are stored as `.yaml` files in the `binning` folder.

## Templates

The templates that build the four-dimensional likelihood are stored in the `templates` folder. There are four components:

- **Accidental coincidence (AC):** `templates/sr*/ac/template_XENONnT_sr*_ac_cevns.h5`
- **Electronic recoil (ER):** `templates/sr*/er/template_XENONnT_sr*_er_cevns.h5`
- **Neutron:** `templates/sr*/rg/template_XENONnT_sr*_rg_cevns_tly_*_tqy_*.h5`
- **Monoenergetic nuclear recoil (NR):** `templates/sr*/mono/template_XENONnT_sr*_mono_*_cevns_tly_*_tqy_*.h5`

The monoenergetic NR templates are used to construct the solar neutrino and light dark matter templates, given their respective NR spectra. These templates are dimensionless and represent the detection efficiency. All other components are expressed in units of `/t/y`. The four-dimensional binned distribution for each component can be accessed through the `.histogram` attribute of the object returned by `inference_interface.template_to_multihist`.

The wildcards are defined as follows:

- `sr*` — distinguishes between science runs
- `tly_*` and `tqy_*` — correspond to the nuisance parameters modeling the light yield and charge yield uncertainties
- `mono_*` — indicates the energy of the monoenergetic NR

## Limits

The 90% confidence level upper limits on the light dark matter particle–nucleon interaction cross section are stored in the `limits` folder.

## Example

An example of reading data, binning, templates, and limits can be found in `plot.ipynb`.
